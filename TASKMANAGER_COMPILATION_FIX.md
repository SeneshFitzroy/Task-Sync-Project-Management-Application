# 🔧 TASKMANAGER COMPILATION ERROR - FIXED

## ❌ **Problem Identified**

The Flutter application was failing to compile with the following error:
```
lib/main.dart:132:44: Error: Couldn't find constructor 'TaskManager'.
        '/taskmanager': (context) => const TaskManager(),
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was caused by a **circular export statement** in the TaskManager.dart file:

```dart
// Problematic code in TaskManager.dart:
export 'TaskManager.dart';  // This creates a circular reference
```

This export statement was trying to export the file from within itself, causing the Dart compiler to fail when resolving the TaskManager constructor.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

**Fixed the circular export by removing the problematic export line:**

### Before (Lines 1-10 in TaskManager.dart):
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import 'dart:async';
import '../Components/nav_bar.dart';
import '../Services/firebase_service.dart';
// Import other screens that we'll navigate to
// import './Profile.dart';

// Explicitly export TaskManager class
export 'TaskManager.dart';  // ❌ PROBLEMATIC LINE
```

### After (Lines 1-5 in TaskManager.dart):
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import 'dart:async';
import '../Components/nav_bar.dart';
import '../Services/firebase_service.dart';
```

## 🎯 **Fix Details**

1. **Removed the circular export**: Eliminated `export 'TaskManager.dart';`
2. **Kept all functionality intact**: All 1460 lines of TaskManager functionality preserved
3. **Maintained proper imports**: All necessary imports remain functional
4. **No breaking changes**: TaskManager constructor and all methods remain unchanged
