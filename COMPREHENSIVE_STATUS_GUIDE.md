## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

### **Fix Permission-Denied Errors (2 minutes):**

1. **Deploy Firestore Rules** (CRITICAL):
   ```
   - Run: fix_permissions_now.bat (already opened Firebase Console)
   - In Firebase Console: Go to Firestore Database → Rules
   - Replace ALL rules with:
   
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   
   - Click "Publish" and wait for success
   ```

2. **Test App Functionality**:
   ```bash
   # Run the app
   test_app_now.bat
   
   # Or manually:
   flutter pub get
   flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8080
   ```
