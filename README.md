## Problem Definition 😕 

Managing university group projects is often challenging due to the lack of a unified platform for collaboration, task management, and project outcome sharing. Currently, students rely on multiple fragmented tools for communication, task tracking, and documentation. Many of these tools offer limited free trials, and the necessary features are often locked behind paid versions. This fragmentation leads to miscommunication, unstructured task delegation, difficulty in tracking progress, and limited visibility of completed projects.

There is a clear need for a single, unified platform that integrates all aspects of project management, improving organization, collaboration, and productivity. 💡
