## 🔧 Fixing Permission Errors

Currently, you're seeing permission errors because Firestore security rules need to be configured. Here's how to fix this:

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Recommended)
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `team-sync-project-management`
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. Replace the current rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read and write access for development
    // TODO: Implement proper authentication in production
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **Publish** to deploy the rules

### Option 2: Local Development
The firestore.rules file has been created in your project. To deploy:
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login: `firebase login`
3. Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
