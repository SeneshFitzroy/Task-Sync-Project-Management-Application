**The fix_permissions_now.bat script has opened Firebase Console.**

**Complete these steps:**
1. In the Firebase Console tab that opened
2. Go to: **Firestore Database â†’ Rules**  
3. Click **"Edit rules"**
4. **REPLACE ALL** existing rules with:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
5. Click **"Publish"**
6. Wait for **"Rules published successfully"**

---

## ðŸš€ **AFTER RULES DEPLOYMENT:**

### **Test the App:**
```bash
# Run this to test your app:
final_test_app.bat
```

### **Add Team Data:**
```bash  
# After app works, run this for realistic data:
add_team_data.bat
```
